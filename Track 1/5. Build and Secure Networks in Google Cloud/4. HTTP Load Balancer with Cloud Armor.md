# HTTP Load Balancer with Cloud Armor

Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancing is implemented at the edge of Google's network in Google's points of presence (POP) around the world. 
User traffic directed to an HTTP(S) load balancer enters the POP closest to the user and is then load balanced over Google's global network to the closest backend that has sufficient capacity available.

Cloud Armor IP allowlist/denylist enable one to restrict or allow access to HTTP(S) load balancer at the edge of the Google Cloud, 
as close as possible to the user and to malicious traffic. 
This prevents malicious users or traffic from consuming resources or entering the virtual private cloud (VPC) networks.
