# VPC Networks - Controlling Access

Network and Security Admin roles

The following roles are used in conjunction with single-project networking to independently control administrative access to each VPC Network:
Network Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates.                                        
Security Admin: Permissions to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and SSL certificates.                                                                        
              
The Compute Engine default service account does not have the right permissions to allow listing or deleting firewall rules.                                   

Service accounts                                                                                                                
A service account is a special account that can be used by services and applications running on the Compute Engine instance to interact with other Google Cloud APIs.   
A service account is an identity that an instance or an application can use to run API requests on your behalf.                                                    
In addition, one can create firewall rules that allow or deny traffic to and from instances based on the service account that is associated with each instance.        

Two types of service accounts are available to Compute Engine instances:                                                                                         
User-managed service accounts                                                                                                                                      
Google-managed service accounts

# Objectives

1. Create two web servers.                                                                                                                                            
   On VM instance, under Networking choose network tag as 'web-server'                                                                                               
   
2. Create firewall rule
   
3. Explore the Network and Security Admin roles
