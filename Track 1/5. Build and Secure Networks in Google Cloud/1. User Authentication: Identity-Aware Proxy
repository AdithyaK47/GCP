# User Authentication: Identity-Aware Proxy

Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is a Google Cloud Platform service that intercepts web requests sent to the application, 
authenticates the user making the request using the Google Identity Service, and only lets the requests through if they come from a user that is authorized

# Objectives

1. Deploy the application which is protected with IAP
2. Access User Identity Information
3. Use Cryptographic Verification

Last two steps are done using closer examination of application files.
