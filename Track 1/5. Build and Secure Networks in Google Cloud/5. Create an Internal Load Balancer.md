# Create an Internal Load Balancer

Internal Load Balancing enables to run and scale services behind a private load balancing IP address that is accessible only to internal virtual machine instances.           
The external load balancer is used to route external HTTP traffic into the cluster.                                                                                         
The internal load balancer is used for internal service discovery and load balancing within the cluster.
