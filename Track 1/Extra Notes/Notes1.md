# Basics

The term Cloud refers to a Network or Internet. 
In other words, we can say that Cloud is something, which is present at remote location. 
Cloud can provide services over public and private networks, i.e., WAN, LAN or VPN.

Cloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing the hardware and software resources remotely. 
It offers online data storage, infrastructure, and application.

Cloud computing offers platform independency, as the software is not required to be installed locally on the PC. 
Deployment models define the type of access to the cloud, i.e., how the cloud is located? 
Cloud can have any of the four types of access: Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community.

Cloud computing is based on service models. These are categorized into three basic service models which are IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share single physical instance of an application or resource among multiple organizations or tenants (customers).
It does this by assigning a logical name to a physical resource and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.
The Multitenant architecture offers virtual isolation among the multiple tenants.

Service-Oriented Architecture helps to use applications as a service for other applications regardless the type of vendor, product or technology. 
Therefore, it is possible to exchange the data between applications of different vendors without additional programming or making changes to services.

Grid Computing refers to distributed computing, in which a group of computers from multiple locations are connected with each other to achieve a common objective. . 
These computer resources are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed.

Utility computing is based on Pay-per-Use model. It offers computational resources on demand as a metered service.

Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub components required for cloud computing. 

The front end refers to the client part of cloud computing system. It consists of interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms.
The back End refers to the cloud itself. It consists of all the resources required to provide cloud computing services.

Cloud infrastructure consists of servers, storage devices, network, cloud management software, deployment software, and platform virtualization.

Hypervisor is a firmware or low-level program that acts as a Virtual Machine Manager. 
It allows to share the single physical instance of cloud resources between several tenants.

The server helps to compute the resource sharing and offers other services such as resource allocation and de-allocation, monitoring the resources, providing security etc.

Cloud keeps multiple replicas of storage. If one of the storage resources fails, then it can be extracted from another one, which makes cloud computing more reliable.
