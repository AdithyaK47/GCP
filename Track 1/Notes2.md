Cloud deployment refers to the enablement of SaaS (software as a service), 
PaaS (platform as a service) or IaaS (infrastructure as a service) solutions that may be accessed on demand by end users or consumers.

Cloud deployment includes all of the required installation and configuration steps that must be implemented before user provisioning can occur.

3 Service Models Of Cloud Computing

The Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS) means the outsourcing of the physical infrastructure of IT (network, storage, and servers) from a third party provider. 
The IT resources are hosted on external servers and users can access them via an internet connection.

Platform as a Service (PAAS) allows outsourcing of hardware infrastructure as well software environment, which includes databases, integration layers, runtimes and more.

Software as a service (SaaS)  is a cloud computing offering that provides users with access to a vendorâ€™s cloud-based software. 
Users do not install applications on their local devices. Instead, the applications reside on a remote cloud network accessed through the web or an API. 
Through the application, users can store and analyze data and collaborate on projects.



A cloud deployment model refers to the type of cloud computing architecture a cloud solution will be implemented on.
There are four main types: public, private, hybrid and community clouds.

Public cloud: The name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers.
Customers have no control over the location of the infrastructure.
Reduced costs, but security is a concern.


Private cloud: There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar. 
However, as opposed to a public cloud that is available to the general public, only one specific company owns a private cloud. 
The server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the owner company. A clearly defined scope of people have access to the information kept in a private repository, 
which prevents the general public from using it.


Community cloud: A community deployment model largely resembles the private one; the only difference is the set of users.
Whereas only one company owns the private cloud server, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources of a community cloud.
Community members generally share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security. 
This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted internally or by a third-party vendor.


Hybrid cloud: As is usually the case with any hybrid phenomenon, a hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the abovementioned deployment models
Further, as part of this deployment of cloud computing model, the internal, or external providers can provide resources.
