# Cloud Functions: Qwik Start - Console

Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. 
With Cloud Functions one can write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from the cloud infrastructure and services. 
Cloud Function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. The code executes in a fully managed environment.

Cloud Functions are written in Javascript and execute in a Node.js environment on Google Cloud
Cloud Functions provides a connective layer of logic that allows to write code to connect and extend cloud services.
It also allows to address an increasing number of use cases with arbitrary programming logic.


Cloud events are things that happen in your cloud environment.
These might be things like changes to data in a database, files added to a storage system, or a new virtual machine instance being created.

A trigger is a declaration that one is interested in a certain event or set of events.
Binding a function to a trigger allows capturing and acting accordingly on events.

Cloud Functions removes the work of managing servers, configuring software, updating frameworks, and patching operating systems.
The software and infrastructure are fully managed by Google, one may just write the code.

Use cases:
1. Mobile Backend (Firebase)
2. IoT
3. Data Processing / ETL
4. Webhooks
5. Lightweight APIs
