# Buckets

Buckets are the basic containers that hold every data. Everything that is stored in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. 
One can use buckets to organize the data and control access to the data, but unlike directories and folders, one cannot nest buckets. 
Because there are limits to bucket creation and deletion, one should design the storage applications to favor intensive object operations and relatively few buckets operations.

When a bucket is created, a globally-unique name, a geographic location where the bucket and its contents are stored, 
and a default storage class should be specified. The default storage class that is chosen applies to objects added to the bucket that don't have a storage class specified explicitly.

The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There is a single global namespace shared by all buckets.
