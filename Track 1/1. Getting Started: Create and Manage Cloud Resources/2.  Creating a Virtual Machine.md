Compute Engine lets one to create virtual machines running different operating systems, 
including multiple flavors of Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Suse, Red Hat, CoreOS) and Windows Server, on Google infrastructure. 


Regions & Zones 

Certain Compute Engine resources live in regions or zones. 
A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. 
Each region has one or more zones. 

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. 
Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone.
To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone.
Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP. 


NGINX web server, one of the most popular web servers in the world, is used to connect virtual machine to something.
