Google Cloud houses a collection of permissions and roles that define who has access to what resources. We can use the Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to inspect and modify such roles and permissions. 

Basic Roles 

Roles/viewer: Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data. 

Roles/editor: All viewer permissions, plus permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources. 

Roles/owner: All editor permissions and permissions for the following actions: Manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project; Set up billing for a project.
