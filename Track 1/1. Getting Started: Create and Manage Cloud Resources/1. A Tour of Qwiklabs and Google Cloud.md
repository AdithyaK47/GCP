# A Tour of Qwiklabs and Google Cloud


A Google Cloud Platform is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources.

The Navigation menu is an important component of the Cloud Console, there are seven categories of Google Cloud services.
Compute, Storage, Networking, Cloud operations, Tools, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.


Google Cloud houses a collection of permissions and roles that define who has access to what resources. 
We can use the Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to inspect and modify such roles and permissions.

Basic Roles
1) Roles/viewer: Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.
2) Roles/editor: All viewer permissions, plus permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources.
3) Roles/owner: All editor permissions and permissions for the following actions: 
   Manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project; Set up billing for a project.


Cloud Shell is an in-browser command prompt execution environment that allows to enter commands at a terminal prompt to manage resources and services in the Google Cloud project.
