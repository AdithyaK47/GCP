# Steps

1. Create a VPC manually with given features. Take care to mention zone of the subnet as the zone mentioned in the lab.                                                         
   This step is quite easy compared to other steps.

2. Before creating a new VPC using deploy manager, copy all files from the given location.                                                                 
   The command for that will be:                                                                                                                                
   gsutil cp -r gs://cloud-training/gsp321/dm .                                                                                      
   (Do not forget the punctuation(.))                                                                                     
   Change directory to dm. (Command: cd dm)                                                                                       
   Edit the 'prod-network.yaml' using a text editor of choice to update the zone in that file.                                                               
   Create a VPC using deploy manager with this edited file as config                                                                            
   cd .. (Command to move the directory one level up from the current directory/“..” represents parent directory)                                      
   
3. Can be done through console or using shell.                                                                                                  
   Create a VM instance connected to 2 networks mentioned.                                                                                               
   Setup firewall rules for both networks with target tag as ssh and allowing tcp 22 connection. Source range could be taken as 0.0.0.0/0                      
   
4. Create a CloudSQL instance through console/shell                                                                                         
   Activate the created instance through shell                                                                                          
   Run this command for that: gcloud sql connect [instance name]                                                                               
   Enter commands provided in the lab.                                                                                                           
   Note: \q for quit                                                                                                                                   
   
5. Create Kubernetes cluster through console or shell                                                                                                     
   Important note: Run the following command after creating cluster(either way)                                                                          
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials [cluster name] --zone [mentioned-zone]                                                                             
   Else, it will throw error later.                                                                                                                              
   Error will be like: The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?                                                
   The issue is that the kubeconfig is not right. To auto-generate it, run the command provided.                                                                             
   
6. As done earlier, run the copy command and change directory to the folder containing yaml files (wp-k8s)                                                  
   Edit wp-env.yaml file by opening it with a text editor and update the username and password with the one provided in the lab.                                       
   Now, create the deployment using updated wp-env.yaml file.                                                                                                       
   Then, run commands mentioned in the lab.                                                                                                         
   Note: Delete an accidentally created deployment using this command: kubectl delete deployment [name]                                                             
   
7. Open wp-deployment.yaml using any text editor                                                                                                                   
   Edit it, replace YOUR_SQL_INSTANCE with MYSQL CloudSQL Instance connection name                                                                                   
   Now, create the deployment using updated wp-deployment.yaml file.                                                                                           
   Create a deployment using wp-service.yaml file.                                                                                                                    
   Run this command to get external IP of Wordpress server (It is needed for next task): kubectl get service                                                           
   Note: If external IP is on pending state, run this command after few seconds and until it is provided.                                                          
   
8. Create an Uptime check                                                                                                                                   
   Type will be HTTP and Resource type is URL                                                                                                          
   Provide the external IP of the Wordpress server as Hostname                                                                                                  
   Test it and create the check.                                                                                                                     
                  
9. Use IAM to provide access to another user.                                                                                                                            
   Note: Provide role to be editor, as it is an additional engineer working on the project.
