# Google Cloud Program
A repository to document my Google Cloud Program journey, as a part of 30 days of Google Cloud.

It is a program by Google which provides enrolled candidates a hands-on practice on Google Cloud Platform aka GCP. 
The program introduces Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Qwiklabs.

The program is divided into two tracks.
(i) Cloud Engineering Track
(ii) Data Science & Machine Learning Track

Each track contains six skill badges, which is required to complete a track.
